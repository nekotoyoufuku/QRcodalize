    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy outlines how our app ("the App") collects, uses, and
      shares user information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and
      ensuring that any personal information collected is handled in a secure
      and responsible manner.
    </p>
    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>
      The App provides QR code creation and saving functionality but does not
      collect any personal information from users. Specifically, the App does
      not collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Personal identification information (such as name, email address, or
        phone number)
      </li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Other personal data stored on the device</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
    <p>
      The App is designed to allow users to generate and save QR codes. The
      information input by users (e.g., URLs or Wi-Fi credentials) is used
      solely for the purpose of generating QR codes. This data is never
      transmitted outside of the app or stored on any external servers.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Sharing of Information</h3>
    <p>
      We do not share any personal information with third parties. All data
      generated or saved by the user remains on their device and is not uploaded
      to any external systems.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
      Any QR codes created or saved using the App are stored locally on the
      user's device. The App does not store data on cloud servers or external
      databases. Users can manage and delete their data at any time directly
      from their device.
    </p>
    <h3>5. Security</h3>
    <p>
      The App is designed so that no user data is transmitted externally,
      minimizing the risk of data breaches. All data remains under the user's
      control and is stored only on their device.
    </p>
    <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in legal
      requirements or in the Appâ€™s functionality. Any updates will be
      communicated within the App or on our official website.
